# Graph-Visualization-Tool

Objective of research: We seek to make the organ transplant process as fair as possible. We are experimenting with different allocation algorithms to pioneer a new way to manage donated organs in the United States.

There are two parts of this show-case.
1) Log.h and Log.cpp is an example of my coding in C++. This is a modification of the code-base which I submitted. It logs all run-time events for each algorithm we implemented.
2) geocoding.py and graph.py make up a visualization tool in Python which can be used to create any of the four maps found in the directory 'demo'.
